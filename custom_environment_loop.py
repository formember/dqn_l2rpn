  This takes `Environment` and `Actor` instances and coordinates their

  A `Counter` instance can optionally be given in order to maintain counts
  between different Acme components. If not given a local Counter will be
  created to maintain counts between calls to the `run` method.

  A `Logger` instance can also be passed in order to control the output of the
  loop. If not given a platform-specific default logger will be used as defined
  by utils.loggers.make_default_logger. A string `label` can be passed to easily
  change the label associated with the default logger; this is ignored if a
  `Logger` instance is given.
